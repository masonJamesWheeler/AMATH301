    "By factoring the function $f(x)$, we find that the exact root of the function in the interval $0 ≤ x ≤ 4$ is $x = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n",

    "After three iterations of the bisection method, the root is guaranteed to be in the interval $[0.5, 1]$.\n",

    "The error after n iterations of the bisection method can be expressed as $\\frac{(b - a)}{2^n}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the endpoints of the initial interval, and $n$ is the number of iterations. We want this to be less than $10^{-6}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "For Newton's method to fail, the derivative of the function at the point of interest would need to be zero, as this would result in division by zero in the iteration formula.\n",
